And watch from far away\n

But you always knew that you'd be\n
The one that work while they all play\n

In youth, you lay, awake at night and scheme\n
Of all the things that you would change\n
But it was just a dream\n

Here we are, don't turn away now\n
We are the warriors that built this town\n
Here we are, don't turn away now\n
We are the warriors that built this town from dust\n

The time will come, when you'll have to rise\n
Above the best, improve yourself\n
Your spirit never dies\n

Farewell, I've gone, to take my throne\n
Above, don't weep for me because\n
This will be the labor of my love\n

Here we are, don't turn away now\n
We are the warriors that built this town\n
Here we are, don't turn away now\n
We are the warriors that built this town from dust"
